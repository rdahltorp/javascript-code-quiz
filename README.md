# Code Quiz

## Description

The code for this application is used to run a coding quiz intended to test the user's base knowledge of JavaScript. 

The code runs off JavaScript for the funcationality and CSS for the style. 

While developing this application I learned a lot more about how JavaScript can influence the HTML in addition to the syntax and different methods you can use to execute unique things in your code (from starting/stopping timers to replacing entire lines of copy).


## Installation

To install, run, and work on the quiz code on your machine, clone down the index.html, style.css, script.js, and README.md files. Then open them in a source code editor.


## Usage

The active application will take the user through a series of multiple choice questions. When the user completed the questions or when time runs out, they will be able to see their score and submit them to keep track of their high scores for later viewing.   

Here is a quick demo of the application in action:
