<p>Welcome! This quiz is intened to test your base knowledge of JavaScript. When you press the strat button below, you will be asked a series of questions pretaining to JavaScript.
As you progress the timer in the top right will begin to count down. Once you make it to the end, you can enter your name/initials to save your highscore. But be careful. 
Each wrong answer decreases the time by 10 seconds, and if the timer reaches 0 before you are done, it will be game over! 
Have fun and good luck! </p> 
<button> START </button>

///WHEN START IS PRESSED
- WHen the user hits start, the quiz triggers. 
- The welcome copy gets swapped for the first question, which then has 4 options to choose from. 
- Once the user clicks one of the options the question swaps to the next and at the bottom of question a line of text triggers saying "incorrect" or "correct". If incorrect the timer decreases by 10 seconds
- User proceeds to answer all questions
